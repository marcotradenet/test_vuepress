# Blocked accounts
In order to preserve the token price stability, we've decided to block some users from sending the token too early.  
These users are not common users but are people that have contributed to the Commercio.network early stage development 
and which tokens selling might compromise the whole token stability. 

Such blocked accounts **are not able to send any kind of token to any user**. 
If they try to do so, the transaction will simply fail and will not be considered valid from the whole system. 

## Adding a blocked account
In order to add an account as blocked you need to be the [government](../government/README.md).  
If you are, you can then perform the [account blocking transaction](./tx/account-blocking.md).

## Unlocking a blocked account
In order to unlock a previously blocked account you need to be the [government](../government/README.md).  
If you are, you can then perform the [account unlocking transaction](./tx/account-unlock.md).
